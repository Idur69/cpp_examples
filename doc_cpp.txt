To RUN CPP file:
we have to compile and excute the exutable file.

test.cpp file name

1 Compile with g++ compiler
--> g++ test.cpp -o test

2 Run executable
--> ./test


Data Types:

1.Built in DataTypes:

int (1,2,3,4)
float (3.5, 43.4)
char ('c','tw')
double(12.23232,45.343434)
boolean (True or false)

2.User Defined datatypes:

1.Struct:
Structure is a collection of variables of different data types under a single name. It is similar to a class in that, both holds a collecion of data of different data types.

2.Union
3.Enum:
An enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants. To define an enumeration, keyword enum is used.
An enum variable takes only one value out of many possible values.

3. Derived Datatypes:
1.Array
2.Function
3.Pointer

# Headerfiles and Types:
1.System define header files : it comes with compiler
2.User define header fiels : it is  written by programmer


Pointers:
what is pointer?
pointer is datatype which hold the address of other data types.

& --> Address of operator
* --> Deference operator
:: --> scope operator

Arrays:
An Array is collection of items of same types stored in continueos memory location.
Sometimes,a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.

Examples : Let say, we want to store marks of 2500 students, having 2500 different variable for this task is not feasible.
To solve this we can define an array with size 2500 that can hold marks of all students.

Pointer arhtmatic:

address(new) = address(current) + i * sizeof(datatype)
