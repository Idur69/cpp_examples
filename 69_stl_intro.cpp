/*
Standard Template Library (STL)
Why it is import in competitive programming?
1. you will be given limited time to code your program.
2. supose you want in your program,
--> reasizable an array
-->sort an array
--> any other data structure
--> search for some elements in your computer.

Libarary of what?
STL is a library of generic function and classes which saves time and energy
which would have spent constructing for your use.

--> This help you to reuse these well tested classes and functions.

--> STL is used because of good idea not to reinnovate car wheel.
use it to modifiy where it left. 
Components of STL:
1. Containers
2. Algorithm
3. Iterators

1.Containers:
--> constainers is  object which stores data
--> use template classes

2. Algorithms:
    Procedure to process dat
--> sorting
--> searching
--> use template functions

3. Iterators:
-->Iterators are objects which points  refer to an element in a container
-->Handled just like pointers
-->Connect algorithms with containers.


Type of Containers:
1. sequence container
--> to store data in linear fashion 
--> Vector
    -> random acces is fast
    -> middle insertion and deletion is slow
    -> insertion and deletion at the end is fast
--> List
    -> random access is slow
    -> middle insertion and deletion is fast
    -> insertion and deletion at the end is fast
--> Dequeue

2. Associative container
    All operations are fast execpt random access.
--> Direct access
--> Tree structure
--> set / multi set
--> map / multi map

3. Derived container
   Depends on data structures
--> Real world modeling
--> stack --> LIFO (Last In First OUT)
--> queue --> FIFO (First In First OUT)
--> priority queue
